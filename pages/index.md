          After graduation, I joined Alphacamp which is the largest bootcamp in Aisa. Not only it provides environment where I could learn skills of web development and build real product, but also it connects us to information technology industry. We built a online service called foodudes from 0 to 1 in three months. It's a final solution for searching terrific restaurants by a platform people who can share their favorite restaurants with their friend. The most important lesson I learn is “Try fast, fail fast” to validate whether your idea works or not by publishing your minimum valuable product to the market ASAP.
