        Alpha camp is a startup school where we learn skills, build stuff and finally connect with the industry. My colleague and I build a service called foodudes.The purpose is we want to solve the problem of searching good restaurants, and then we did some brain storming, finally, we consider that build a platform for people who can share their favorite restaurants with their friend is the solution we want.<br/><br/>
        During this semester, I acted as a full-stack web developer with Ruby on Rails and Javascript. I try to design and develope application programming interface for both web and iOS. 3rd-party application like Google Map and Social network login are also implemented. However, I failed to make website RWD because of the lacking of my graphic design skill. I realize that there are lots of skill to pick up and one of them is graphic design if I would like to be a web developer.

        iCook is the biggest recipe planform in Taiwan. No  waday, 100,000 recipes are shared by 2,000,000 signed user since  September 2012. During this period I learned  how to collbaborate with my talent colleagues under the modern web development flow.

        Besides keep practicing back-end skills, I learned modern front-end development in my leisure time. After several months, I try to play on back-end and front-end in the same time. There are always new stuff to learn and new technique born every moment, but that's why being a web developer is so facinating to me.

        As a staff in a small enterprise  is easy to get involved in the process of every decision made. In these months, I have participated  lots of projects from the beginning, some of them still online, but most of them dead because user have no interest in it. “Try fast, Fail fast” is one of the most precious lesson I learned from.
