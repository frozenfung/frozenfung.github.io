        Joining Alpha camp is the one of the most important choice in my life. It is a startup school where we learn skills, build stuff and finally connect with the industry. My colleague and I build a service called foodudes.

        The purpose is we want to solve the problem of searching good restaurants, and then we did some brain storming, finally, we consider that build a platform for people who can share their favorite restaurants with their friend is the solution we want.

        During this play, I acted as a full-stack web developer with Ruby on Rails and Javascript. I try to design and develope application programming interface for both web and iOS. 3rd-party application like Google Map and Social network login are also implemented.

        Also it is the first time I learn the concept of responsive web design. However, I failed to make website RWD because of the lacking of my graphic design skill. I realize that there are lots of skill to pick up and one of them is graphic design if I would like to be a web developer.

        iCook is the biggest recipe planform in Taiwan. No  waday, 100,000 recipes are shared by 2,000,000 signed user since  September 2012. During this period I learned  how to collbaborate with my talent colleagues under the modern web development flow. Also I experienced the process of building a web application from 0 to 1.

        Besides keep practicing back-end skills, I learned modern front-end development with my leisure time. After a while I realized it is a long way to be a senior developer even if I could develope in both front-end and back-end. Too much to learn and new technique born every moment, but this is the exact reason why being a developer is so facinating to me.

        As a staff in a small enterprise  is easy to get involved in the process of every decision made. In these months, I have participated  lots of projects from the beginning, some of them still online, but most of them dead because user have no interest in it. “Try fast, Fail fast” is one of the most precious lesson I learned from, and it is the core concept of lean startup.
