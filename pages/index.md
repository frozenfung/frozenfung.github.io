          After graduation, I joined Alphacamp. Alphacamp is a startup school where we learn skills, build stuff and finally connect us with the industry. My classmates and I build a service called foodudes in three months. It is the final solution for searching terrific restaurant by a platform people who can share their favorite restaurants with their friend. In this project, I acted as a full-stack web developer with Ruby on Rails and Javascript. However, the most important lesson I learn is “Try fast, fail fast” to validate whether your idea works or not by publishing your minimum valuable product to the market ASAP.
